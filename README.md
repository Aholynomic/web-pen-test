A Penetration Test of a Randomised Web App

## Purpose
A pen test was conducted on a provided web app, which was injected with vulnerabilities. The assessment in CMP319 was covered in two parts.
The first was a review of the web app and the methodology of the pen test. The second was detailing the vulnerabilities found and finding 
countermeasures to these with the source code that was provided. These sections are highlighted as shown on the title page.

Grade (Part 1): B+

## Note
The PDF is extremely long. I would not be surpised if people find it hard to navigate. I wasn't particularly good at report writing 
back then, and it shows.
